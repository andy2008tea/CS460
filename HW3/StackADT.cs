	/// <summary>
	/// Push an item onto the top of the stack. Pushing an object that 
	/// doesn’t exist should result in an error and should not succeed.
	/// Pushing an object that is not an item should result in an error.
	/// This operation returns a reference (pointer or link, but not a copy)
	/// to the item pushed so that an anonymous object can be pushed and then used. </summary>
	/// <param name="newItem"> The object to push onto the top of the stack.  Should not be null </param>
	/// <returns> A reference to the object that was pushed, or null if newItem == null </returns>

	/// Remove and return the top item on the stack. This operation should 
	/// result in an error if the stack is empty. Returns a reference to the 
	/// item removed. </summary>
	/// <returns> A reference that was popped (and removed) from the stack or null if
	/// 			the stack is empty </returns>
	object pop();

	/// <summary>
	/// Return the top item but do not remove it. Generally should result in 
	/// an error if the stack is empty. An acceptable alternative is to return 
	/// something which the user can use to check to see if the stack was in fact empty. </summary>
	/// <returns> A reference to the item currently on the top of the stack or null if
	/// 			the stack is empty </returns>

	/// <summary>
	/// Query the stack to see if it is empty or not. Cannot produce an error. </summary>
	/// <returns> True if the stack is empty, false otherwise </returns>

	/// Reset the stack by emptying it. The exact technique used to clear 
	/// the stack is up to the implementor. The user should pay attention to what 
	/// this behavior is.
